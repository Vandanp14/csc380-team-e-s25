Centro Bus Tracker App

Project Overview:
This project collects, stores, and analyzea real-time bus tracking data from the Centro API to improve schedule accuracy predictions. The data is stored in a MySQL database and accessible through a web interface that allows users to search, filter, and obtain bus route information and analyze schedule accuracy. This software is targeted towards SUNY Oswego students and, hence is limited to only a few Oswego Bus Routes.
